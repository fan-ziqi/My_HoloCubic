# MPU6050 by Electronic Cats

MPU-6050 6-axis accelerometer/gyroscope Arduino Library
adapted for Arduino Library Manager by Electronic Cats, Feb 2019

The MPU6050 combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer on the same silicon die together with
an onboard Digital Motion Processor(DMP) which processes complex 6-axis MotionFusion algorithms.

### Original Library
